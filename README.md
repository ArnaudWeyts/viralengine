#Viralengine

**Idk what I'm doing tbh but React is pretty cool. üê∏**

This is going to be a search engine for viral posts built on top of react.

Built using a customized build process, based on the ejected process of create-react-app.

To install:

```sh
$ yarn
```

Get your version running on localhost:

```sh
$ yarn start
```
