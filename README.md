#Viralengine

**‚ö†Ô∏è This project is going to be slow af until I actually know what I'm doing in React üòÇ.**

This is going to be a search engine for viral posts built on top of react.

Do keep in mind that this is more of a learning experience for me, getting to know React.

To install:

```sh
$ yarn
```

Get your version running on localhost:

```sh
$ gulp
```
